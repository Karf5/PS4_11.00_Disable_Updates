# PS4_11.00_Disable_Updates

Simple Payload to disable system updates for PS4 version 11.00 

There are many versions of this Payload, but this version is completely developed by me and it supports PS4 models that have problems activating Payloads

How to use it with the Payload Guest application 

Create a folder called payloads inside your USB storage device. The USB storage device must be in exFAT or FAT32 file system and copy the PS4_11.00_Disable_Updates.bin file to the payloads folder. Insert the USB storage device in the PS4 and turn on the BinLoader Server option in the GoldHEN settings, then Launch Payload Guest app and launch the Payload

NOTE : If You Using HEN-VTX Or Playstation 4 Special Homebrew Enabler, You Don't Need To Launch The BinLoader Server Just Launch The Payload Normaly

You can use other methods such as : 

 1 - Launch Payload through the browser 

 2 - Launch Payload through PPPwn exploit
